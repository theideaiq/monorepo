## 2025-02-18 - Co-location of Internationalization Logic

Structure: Internationalization routing logic (`navigation.ts`) is now co-located with `request.ts` in `src/i18n/`.
Rule: Files that are tightly coupled by domain logic (like `next-intl` configuration and routing) should reside in the same directory, rather than being split between root `src/` and subdirectories.
