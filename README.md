# The IDEA

The IDEA IQ Inc.'s production monorepo: a Next.js + Supabase SaaS platform built for
Iraq-first products. It ships Arabic (RTL) and English (LTR) out of the box, takes
local payments through Wayl, and can be packaged as native iOS and Android apps.

> **Starting a new project from this template?** Run `bun install && bun run init`
> first. It asks for your organization and project details, fills in every
> placeholder token, sets up environment files and removes the modules you don't need.

## Stack

| Concern | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Monorepo | Turborepo + Bun workspaces |
| Web apps | Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui |
| Auth & database | Supabase (Postgres, Row Level Security, phone OTP) |
| Payments | Provider-agnostic `@repo/payments` with Wayl (ZainCash, FIB, Qi Card, cards) |
| Localization | Arabic + English, RTL-aware design system, `Asia/Baghdad` dates, IQD |
| Mobile | Capacitor (iOS + Android) from the same `apps/app` codebase |
| Analytics | GTM, GA4, Meta Pixel, TikTok Pixel, server-side conversions |
| Hosting | Vercel (apps) + Cloudflare (DNS, Turnstile, R2) |
| Quality | Biome via Ultracite, TypeScript strict, Vitest, GitHub Actions |

## Getting started

Prerequisites: Node.js 22+, [Bun](https://bun.sh), and Docker if you want to run
Supabase locally.

```sh
bun install
bun run init      # first time only, when creating a project from the template
bun run dev       # starts every app
```

Each app reads its environment from `.env.local` (created by `init` from the
`.env.example` files). Without credentials the apps still start; integrations whose
keys are missing are disabled.

## Common scripts

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run dev` | Run all apps in development |
| `bun run build` | Build all apps |
| `bun run check` / `bun run fix` | Lint and format with Biome |
| `bun run typecheck` | Type-check every workspace |
| `bun run test` | Run all unit tests |
| `bun run check:placeholders` | Fail if placeholder tokens remain after init |
| `bun run check:rtl` / `bun run check:i18n` | Physical Tailwind utilities / UI text missing from the messages files |
| `bun run db:start` / `db:reset` / `db:test` / `db:types` | Local Supabase, migrations, RLS tests, generated types |
| `bun run build:native` / `bun run cap:sync` | Static export of `apps/app` / copy it into the iOS and Android projects |
